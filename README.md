## Greetings!

My Name is Will, I've been managing enterprise data for almost a decade working with a variety of RDMS and working at specialty retail companies on a global scale.

## What do I do?

I've recently pivoted to more of a technical role, after graduating from a course at MIT. learning more about development and setting up ETL/ELT pipelines to cloud storage/computing clusters with orchestration tools like Airflow.

I've also used computation layers like pyspark and dask to process big data.

Dabbling a bit in reinforcement learning and neural nets I can use linear regression with libraries like Pandas, SKLearn, Numpy, Matplotlib.

## What am I working on now?

I'm currently learning DBT for data transformation.
