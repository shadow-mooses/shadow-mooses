## Greetings!

My Name is Will, I've been managing enterprise data for almost a decade working for specialty retail companies leveraging a variety of RDMS.

## What do I do?

After graduating from a Data Engineering Course at MIT, I've pivoted to more of a technical role. learning more about development and configuration up ETL/ELT pipelines to cloud storage/computing clusters with orchestration tools like Airflow.

I've also used computation layers like pyspark and dask to process big data.

Dabbling a bit in reinforcement learning and neural nets, I can use linear regression with libraries like Pandas, SKLearn, Numpy, Matplotlib.

I have also creatd some simple web applications using Flask.

## What am I working on now?

I'm currently learning DBT for data transformation.
