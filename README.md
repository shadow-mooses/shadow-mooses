## Greetings!

My Name is Will, I've been managing enterprise data for almost a decade working for specialty retail companies leveraging a variety of RDMS.

## What do I do?

After graduating from a Data Engineering Course at MIT, I've pivoted to more of a technical role. Learning more about development and configuration ETL/ELT pipelines to cloud storage and computing clusters with orchestration tools like Airflow.

I've also used computation layers like pyspark and dask to process big data.

Dabbling a bit in reinforcement learning and neural nets, I can use linear regression with libraries like Pandas, SKLearn, Numpy, Matplotlib.

I have also creatd some simple web applications using Flask.

## What am I working on now?

I'm currently learning DBT for data transformation.

## What am I dabbling with?

I have really enjoyed some fundamental software development. I made an interactive task tracker using python, jinja and flask library where users can log daily tasks with time stamps and session cookies for security. I also wrote as well as an app that cleans up a local file directory and organizes files based on their extension type. Both of these are in my public repositories.
